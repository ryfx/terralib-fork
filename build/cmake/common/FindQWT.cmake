# Find the QWT installation.
# (c) Frederico A. Bedê, 2011
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage:
# In your CMakeLists.txt file do something like this:
# ...
# # QWT
# FIND_PACKAGE(QWT)
# ...
# if( QWT_FOUND )
#   include_directories(${QWT_INCLUDE_DIRS})
#   link_directories(${QWT_LIBRARY_DIRS})
# endif( QWT_FOUND )
# ...
# Remember to include ${QWT_LIBRARIES} in the target_link_libraries() statement.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT - You may need to manually set:
#  PATHS in line 35  - path to where the QWT include files are.
#  PATHS in line 40  - path to where the QWT library files are.
#  in case FindQWT.cmake cannot find the include files or the library files.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following variables are set if QWT is found:
#  QWT_FOUND         - Set to true when QWT is found.
#  QWT_INCLUDE_DIR  - Include directories for QWT
#  QWT_LIBRARY     - The QWT libraries.
