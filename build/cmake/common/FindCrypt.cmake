# Find the Crypt installation.
# (c) Frederico A. BedÃª, 2011
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage:
# In your CMakeLists.txt file do something like this:
# ...
# # Crypt
# FIND_PACKAGE(Crypt)
# ...
# if( CRYPT_FOUND )
#   include_directories(${CRYPT_INCLUDE_DIRS})
#   link_directories(${CRYPT_LIBRARY_DIRS})
# endif( CRYPT_FOUND )
# ...
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT - You may need to manually set:
#  PATHS in line 35  - path to where the Crypt include files are.
#  PATHS in line 40  - path to where the Crypt library files are.
#  in case FindCrypt.cmake cannot find the include files or the library files.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following variables are set if Crypt is found:
#  CRYPT_FOUND         - Set to true when CRYPT is found.
#  CRYPT_INCLUDE_DIR  - Include directories for CRYPT
#  CRYPT_LIBRARIES     - The CRYPT libraries.
