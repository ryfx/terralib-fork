The interface displays in the center bottom portion the current color of the visual to be changed.
<br><br>
This interface has 48 predefined basic colors and 16 more customizable colors.
<br><br>
In the upper right portion, the interface has a vertical bar where color intensity can be adjusted. At the right side of the bar, a colors box is displayed. This box shows hue variation in the horizontal direction and saturation variation in the vertical direction. Figure 2 shows in detail the colors box and the bar for color intensity adjustment.

The interface also displays a frame with color values in its Red, Green, and Blue components, which are the basic colors of the visible spectrum, and values in its hue, saturation, and intensity. Alpha channel, although not used, adjusts the color transparency or opacity. Figure 3 shows color values frame in detail.

A color can be adjusted by keyboard typing the Red, Green, and Blue, or the Hue, Saturation, and Intensity parameters. By mouse, a color can be adjusted cliking the vertical bar and the colors box.
<br><br>
  To customize a color, select one of the 16 squares and, using either the mouse 
  or the keyboard, choose a color. Click <em>Add to Custom Colors</em> button. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Usually color selection is executed by pointing one of the custom colors. However, 
  color selection may be executed by pointing directly on the bar and colors box 
  and clicking <em>OK</em> button. </p>
