      <p>A basic tool to estimate the data spatial variability in an area is the Spatial 
        Proximity Matrix, also known as Neighborhood Matrix. The proximity matrix is used 
        to calculate indicators during the exploratory analysis of spatial data for other 
        analysis available in TerraView. Since the calculation is costly and can be executed 
        with criteria, TerraView stores the matrices in the database, allowing the use of 
        them in different analysis to avoid recalculation, thus achieving efficiency.</p>
      <p>To calculate the proximity matrix, select the 
        <b>Analysis</b> <b>- Proximity Matrix - Create Proximity Matrix</b> option in the Menu Bar. 
        The interface shown in the following figure below will be displayed. 
        Once the operation is finished, the created matrix describes, for each object, which other 
        objects are considered to be the nearest ones.</p>

      <p><font face="Arial">1. Choose the <b>Theme</b> with data. 
        Choose UP Theme with the Planning Units for Belo Horizonte in the BH.mdb database. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">2. Select one of the available strategies in <b>Construction Strategy</b> 
        field to decide how objects are close to each other. In this case, select the <b>Contiguity</b> 
        strategy. The options are:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a.<b> Contiguity</b>: An object is near to 
        only other ones with shared borders. This characteristic is highly dependent on objects 
        geometry and the Theme objects geometries must be without digitalization and building 
        errors;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"> b.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial"> 
        <b>Distance</b>: An object is near another one if their centroids are at a 
        distance d specified by the user in the Distance field (enabled when this 
        strategy is selected);</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">c. <b>Nearest Neighbours</b>: 
        An object is near on only the <i>n</i> nearest neighbors (considering centroids), 
        where <i>n</i> is defined by the user in Number of Neighbours field 
        (enabled when this strategy is selected).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"> 3. <b>Weight</b> field allows weights to be assigned to the 
        found proximities. The options are: 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">a. <b>Without Weight</b>: All near objects have the same weight;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">b. <b>Inverse Distance</b>;</font></p>
      <p>c. <b>Squared Inverse Distance</b>.</p>
      <p><font face="Arial"> 4. <b>Save output file</b> option allows the matrix calculated by 
        TerraView to be saved in text files for data interchange with other spatial analysis 
        software. In this case, fill in the format and the location and name of the file.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">5. Click on <b>OK</b>.</font></p>
      <p>The matrix is built and saved in the database, associated with this Theme.</p>

      <p>Using <b>Analysis Proximity Matrix</b> - 
        <b>Select Proximity Matrix</b> menu, the interface shown in Figure below is displayed 
        and it allows the manipulation of the proximity matrices built for a given Theme.</p>

      <p>3. Click on <b>Set Matrix as Default</b> to indicate that the selected matrix is 
        the one to be used in the following spatial operations which need a proximity matrix.</p>
      <p>4. Click on <b>Delete Matrix</b> to delete the selected matrix.<br>
