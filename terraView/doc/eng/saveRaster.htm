           This funcionality allows a raster data stored in a Terraview database to be saved in a file, 
           using some of the common raster data formats.
          <br /><br />
      Directory and output file name can be defined using <b>File</b> button or typed in the text field. 
      If the file already exists, it will be overwritten after user confirmation. 
      <br />
      <br />
          <b>Formats</b>
          <br />
      The available formats for saving a raster data (and available in <b>Format</b>) list are: <br />
            <ol>
            <li>GeoTiff: can store raster data with 1 or 3 bands, pallete or not. This format stores
            common information, such as number of rows and columns, number of bands, and number of bits per 
            raster data element; and geographic information, such as projection and datum, horizontal and 
            vertical resolution, and bounding box;</li>
            <li>JPEG: can store raster data with 1 or 3 bands only if their elements are unsigned char type. 
            Pallete data are converted to 3 bands based on its color table. It is not possible to store 
            geographic information in a JPEG file.</li>
            
            <li>RAW: stores 1 band of the raster data in a binary file sequentially by lines. No informatin about 
            the data is stored.</li>
            <li>SPRING: stores 1 band of the raster data in an ASCII file using the raster interchange format 
             of SPRING software.</li>
            </ol>

            <br /><br />
            <b>Raster Parameters</b><br />
      The interface fields under <b>Raster Parameters</b> is used by the user to select which representation 
      to save. <br />
       <br />
      A TerraView Layer may contain many raster representations associated to different geographic objects. 
      <b>Object</b> field shows identifiers of objects with raster representation in the Layer used to create 
      the Theme. The formats allow saving: 
      <ul>
        <li>1 band: similar to a monochromatic image. The user selects from a list of bands which one will be saved;</li>
            
        <li>3 bands: similar to 3 RGB (Red - Green - Blue) colors image. Raster data must have at least 3 bands. 
            The user selects which band will correspond to each color by clicking on the button that 
            corresponds to the color and selecting in the bands list the band for that color.</li>
            </ul>

           <img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/salvar_raster.png" /><br />
           
           </center>   
           
        <br /><br />   
        <b>Sampling</b> 
        <br />
      Allows the user to degrade the image resolution up to 4 levels (<b>Sampling</b> field). Level 1 is the 
      original resolution, that is, no degradation. 
      <b>Res. X</b> and <b>Res. Y</b> fields show the values of output resolutions. <br />
      <br />
      Output resolutions are obtained multiplying the original resolution by the sampling factor. 
      For instance, if the original resolutions are 30 meters in horizontal and vertical directions, and 
      the sampling factor is 2, output resolutions will be 60 meters. The sampling algorithm is the nearest neighbor.<br />
