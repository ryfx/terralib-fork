      <p>This tool is used to select representation types, visualization scale, and other 
        characteristics related to the theme visualization. The purpose of scale definition is to 
        control the visualization of geometric elements of the theme using restrictions of minimum and/or 
        maximum scale. Suitable scales must be obtained observing the minimum and maximum threshould for 
        the given theme. The interval between the maximum limit, set to 1/1 by default, and the minimum 
        1/x, where (x> 1), is called operational interval of the view. In reality, the expected values for 
        minimum scale are numbers larger than the expected for maximum scale, since they are denominators. 
        The visibility interval contains the interval of scale values in which the geographic objects of 
        the theme will be shown.</p>
      <p> Right-click in the Draw Area to display the context menu presented in the figure below..</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/visibilidade_representacoes.png" border="1"></p>
      <p>Select <b>Visibility of Representations</b>. A new window, shown in the figure below, will be 
        displayed.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/visibilidade_representacoes1.png" width="305" height="513"></p>
      <p>1. Tick the representation types you wish to visualize, for instance points and texts. Note 
      that only the representations available in the theme are enabled.</p>
      <p>2. Tick other items for visualization, such as grouping and legends. Note again that only the 
      items available for the theme are enabled. </p>
      <p>3. Select the Minimum and the Maximum scale for theme visualization. Observe that the value of 
        minimum scale is greater than than the value of maximum scale, since tthe maximum scale indicates 
        the maximum scale of detail for the theme, as explained above.</p>
      <p>4. Click on <b>OK</b>.</p>
      <p>5. Draw Area will be automatically updated with the selected options.</p>
