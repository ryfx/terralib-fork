		<span style='font-size: 13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Vector Data Import</span>
	</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<span style='font-family:Arial'> TerraView imports vector data files in one 
  of these formats: Shapefiles, MID/MIF, TAB/GEO (from SPRING), and BNA (from 
  TabWIN). A database must be connected to TerraView before importing vector data. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>MID/MIF</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Assume that <u>distritos.mif</u> and <u>distritos.mid</u> files contain the 
  map of São Paulo municipality districts with their locations and descriptive 
  attributes. File extensions &quot;.<u>mif</u>&quot; and &quot;.<u>mid</u>&quot; 
  indicate that these files are MAPInfo interchange format and this format can 
  be imported by TerraView. To import files in this format, execute the following 
  steps: <br>
  <br>
  1. Click on <img id="_x0000_i1035" src="importWindow_arquivos/image001.png"> 
  icon in the Tool Bar<b> </b>or select <b>File <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>®</span> 
  Import Data</b> menu. The import interface shown below is displayed: 
  <p align=center> <img id="_x0000_i1034" src="importWindow_arquivos/image002.png"> 
  </p>
  2. Click <em>File</em> button to select the data. Note that type of filter has 
  to be changed to match MID/MIF format files, as shown in the Figure below. Select 
  <u>distritos.mif</u> file and click <em>Open</em> button. 
  <p align=center> <img src="importWindow_arquivos/image003.png" width="308" height="83" id="_x0000_i1033"> 
  </p>
  3. Notice in the Figure below that the import interface identifies data projection 
  since this format stores this projection information. A name for the layer to 
  be created is suggested by the interface. 
  <p align=center> <img id="_x0000_i1032" src="importWindow_arquivos/image004.png"> 
  </p>
  4. Next, the interface presents the <em>Linking Tables of Attributes and Geometries 
  </em> frame to allow the selection of the linking method between districts attributes 
  (in MID file) and their geometries (in MIF file). <em>Automatic</em> option 
  indicates that an attribute will be created with a sequential numbering accordingly 
  to data sequence in the file and this attribute will be used for the linkage 
  <em>Link Column</em> option allows one of the existing attributes (or columns) 
  of the file to be used for the linkage. When this option is selected, verify 
  that the attribute or column value is not repeated in the file. Here, select 
  the second option and SPRROTULO column, as shown in the previous Figure. A confirmation 
  of the choices will be asked by the interface. <br>
  <br>
  5. When import is finished, a new layer will be displayed in the layers tree 
  as shown in the Figure below: 
  <p align=center> <img src="importWindow_arquivos/image005.png" width="180" height="79" id="_x0000_i1031"> 
  </p>
  6. In order to display or manipulate a layer it must be associated to a Theme 
  and included in a View. For that reason, the import procedure offers to create 
  these entities automatically through the question presented in Figure below. 
  Select <em>Yes</em>. 
  <p align=center> <img id="_x0000_i1030" src="importWindow_arquivos/image006.png"> 
  </p>
  7. Notice that a View and a Theme were created and Grid and Draw areas are filled 
  in as shown in Figure below. 
  <p align=center> <img id="_x0000_i1029" src="importWindow_arquivos/image007.png"> 
  </p>
  <strong>Shapefile</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Files in shapefile format are imported using a procedure similar to the one 
  explained in the previous section. Assume that a file with point data related 
  to the location of subway stations in shapefile has to be imported. Shapefile 
  is the exchange format for ESRI products and are composed by three files: &quot;<u>estacoes-metro.shp</u>&quot;, 
  &quot;<u>estacoes-metro.dbf</u>&quot;, and &quot;<u>estacoes-metro.shx</u>&quot;. 
  Follow steps 1 to 3 described above. Note that the filter type has to be changed. 
  The interface shown in Figure below will be presented: 
  <p align=center> <img src="importWindow_arquivos/image008.png" width="347" height="283" id="_x0000_i1028"> 
  </p>
  Notice that the projection could not be retrieved from the file and for that 
  reason the interface indicates data projection to be &quot;NoProjection&quot;. 
  If data projection is known, click <em>Projection...</em><i>button </i>and provide 
  the projection definition presented in the Figure below. 
  <p align=center> <img src="importWindow_arquivos/image009.png" width="343" height="281"></p>
  For each projection, a set of parameters are required. Here subway stations 
  data are projected using UTM, Zone 23, and Datum SAD69. Provide these parameters 
  and click <em>OK </em>button. <br>
  <br>
  Finish the import procedure as shown in the previous example (steps 4, 5, and 
  6). Use ROTULO column for the linkage. <br>
  <br>
  This time select No to the question about imported data visualization. Notice 
  that the layer is available (as seen in the Figure below) but is not automatically 
  displayed. 
  <p align=center> <img src="importWindow_arquivos/image010.png" width="152" height="68" id="_x0000_i1026"> 
  </p>
  <strong>Tab/Geo</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Next, import a file with point data related to the location of train stations 
  in Geo/Tab format. This format is the export format of SPRING data to TerraView. 
  Geo/Tab format is composed by two files: &quot;<u>estacoes-ferroviarias.geo</u>&quot; 
  and &quot;<u>estacoes-ferroviarias.tab</u>. Follow steps 1 to 3 described previously. 
  Note that the filter type has to be changed in step 2. This format does not 
  contain data projection information. If this information is known, provide data 
  projection as described above for shapefile format.&nbsp;Notice that this format 
  does not allow the linking column to be selected since the column is defined 
  by SPRING data. Therefore, step 4 is not applicable for Geo/Tab format. <br>
  <br>
  Here again if the answer for automatic visualization is &quot;No&quot; the layer 
  will be available as shown in Figure below but will not be automatically displayed.
