      <p>For instance, assume that there are socio-economic attributes about Sao Paulo districts. They are in the 
      <u>SOC_ECONOMY.dbf</u> file.  It is known that the link between each district and its geometry is given by 
      the ID field and that the <u>SOC_ ECONOMY.dbf</u> table has a field named <u>DIST</u> with the same values 
      to the field <u>ID</u>. Given that each record of the <u>SOC_ECONOMY.dbf</u> table refers to a single 
      district and that this information does not change with time, this table is called static. A Layer may have more 
      than one static attributes table. Therefore, we can import the table with socio-economic data as another attributes 
      table of the districts layer. Access the <strong>File <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- 
      </font> Import Table...</strong> to display the window shown in the figure below.</p>
     <center> <img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/selec_tabela.png"></center>
      <p>Follow these steps:</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>Click on <strong>File...</strong> button and select the <u>SOC_ECONOMY.dbf</u> table. 
        Observe a sample of the table in the proper field. Note that TerraView recognizes in the DBF file 
        the name and type of each column. Clicking on each column will display its information in the interface 
        field <strong>Columns Definition</strong>. These definitions can not be changed since they are part of 
        the DBF file. <strong></strong></li>
        <li>Select the table <strong>Type</strong> as <strong>Static</strong>.</li>
        <li>Select the <strong>layer</strong> to which the static attributes table is associated with. 
        In this case, select the districts layer.</li>
        <li>Select the column/attribute to be used to link with the districts geometries. In this case, 
        select the <u>DIST</u> field.</li>
        <li>Select the name of the new table. Note that TerraView has a <em>default</em> option.</li>
        <li>Click on <strong>OK</strong> to execute.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now the districts layer has two alphanumeric or descriptive attributes tables: one from the original 
      Shapefile and the other imported from the DBF file. Therefore, the Themes created for this Layer 
      can define which static table will be visible. Right-click on the districts Themes and choose the 
      <strong>Select Theme Tables...</strong> option to display the window shown in the figure below.</p>
      <center> <img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/selec_tabela1.png"></center>      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Note in the interface:
      </p>
      <ol>
      <li>The left hand side of the window shows the list of tables that belong to the Layer which is the 
      source of the Theme;</li>
      <li>The right hand side shows which tables the Theme is currently using;</li>
      <li>The arrows allow transfer of tables for one side to another;</li>
      <li>Transfer the <em>SOC_ECONOMY</em> table to the theme Tables field and click on <strong>OK</strong> to execute.</li>
    </ol></td>
