    <p>The interface is activated through the grid area. At least three variables must be selected 
    in the grid to enable &quot;Dispersion 3D&quot; option in the context menu 
    of the grid viewport. The context menu is shown in Figure 1. </p>

  <p>Selected columns are assigned x, y, and z axis, respectively. To change the assignments, 
    swapping of the grid columns must be executed before activating the 3D graphic 
    plot interface. </p>
  <p>The dispersion 3D graphic interface is shown in Figure 2. TerraView uses QT 
    and opengl libraries to plot the graphic. </font> </div>

   <p>The interface has four drawing areas. The main area displays the data plotted 
    in three dimensions. The remaining drawing areas display the same data plotted 
    in bi-dimensional planes. </p>
   <p>The operation is similar to dispersion 2D graphic. Data representing <i>non 
    pointed objects</i> are drawn using theme default color. Data representing 
    <i>pointed objects are drawn</i> using theme pointing color. </p>
   <p>&quot;Viewing Control&quot; box contains commands to change the visualization 
    mode of 3D data. Displaying tri-dimensional data in a bi-dimensional area 
    requires controls to visualize data at different angles and positions. </p>
   <p>&quot;Show Axis&quot; controls the display of x, y, and z axes. Figure 3 shows 
    the interface without axes display. </font> </div>

  <div align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p>&quot;Quality&quot; 
    slider controls the quality of 3D points plot. Since each point is represented 
    by a sphere, this slider controls the quality of a sphere drawing. The worst 
    the quality is, the faster the plot is. </p>
 
    <p>&quot;Zoom&quot; slider controls the zoom. Figure 4 shows data display with 
    zoom. </font> </div>

   <p>Zoom can also be executed through the mouse the middle button or the roller. Drag 
    the mouse upwards to decrease zoom. Drag the mouse downwards to increase zoom.</p>

   <p>Rotation can also be executed by mouse. Press alt key and left button to control rotation 
    in x and y.Press control key and left button to control rotation in z. If 
    LINUX is used, Alt key must be used with Control key simultaneously. </p>
    <p>&quot;Selection Control&quot; box controls the origin and the size of selection 
    hexagon. Selection hexagon is displayed with magenta color. </p>
   <p>&quot;Offset&quot; and &quot;Size&quot; boxes contain sliders to control the 
    origin and the size of the hexagon in x, y, and z. Figure 7 shows the hexagon 
    in a new location. <p></font> </div>

    control can also be executed by mouse using the three bi-dimensional plane 
    drawing areas. Place the mouse cursor at the center of the rectangle of each 
    drawing area and drag the rectangle to its new location. Place the cursor 
    near the edges to control the rectangle size (hexagon). Figure 8 shows the 
    rectangle being dragged and Figure 9 shows the rectangle being resized. </font>

   <p>Selection is executed every time the hexagon changes either size or position. Figure 
    10 shows the hexagon located on a 3D points cloud. Figure 11 shows the same 
    data in zoom. </p>
    <p>Every time the selection rectangle is changed, a query is executed to search 
    for all objects inside the hexagon. However, when the hexagon is changed by 
    mouse, there is an option to only relocate without a query. Use Control key 
    to use this option. To add the new selection to the current one, use Shift 
    key. </p></font> </div>

   <p>Almost all commands by mouse are available in the interface and only the 3D data 
    translation command is executed exclusively by mouse. Translation is executed 
    by dragging the mouse on the 3D drawing area with the left button pressed 
    down. </p>
    <p>The module allows also the analysis of a subset of data, using: </p>
	<ul>
    <li> all data,</li>
    <li> queried only,</li>
    <li> non queried only,</li>
    <li> grouped only, and</li>
    <li> non grouped only.</li>

    Fig. 12 - List with input data options.</p>
  <p>In addition, the module allows 
  the analysis of data with 1 to n cardinality. When grouping is not used, all 
  grid data are plotted in the interface. When data is grouped, they are summarized 
  by:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>MIN,</li>
  <li>MAX,</li>
  <li>AVG,</li>
  <li>SUM, and</li>
  <li>COUNT.</li>
  </ul>
  Figure 13 shows the list with summary option (grouping functions). </font>

  <p><strong>Observations on 1 to n cardinality.</strong></p>

  <p>The module considers that an object is pointed if at least one of its attributes 
    lines is pointed. Therefore, its graphic representation is drawn on the map 
    using the theme pointing color. Other modules, such as histogram, dispersion, 
    and dispersion 3D, draw objects according to: </p>
  <p>- When there is no grouping function, all table values are used to plot the 
    graphic. In this case, only points or bars related to the attributes pointed 
    on the grid are drawn using the theme pointing color. </p>
  <p>- When a grouping function is used, the summarized values for each object 
    are used to plot the graphic. Therefore, by pointing to a line of its attributes, 
    an object is considered as pointed. Similarly, by satisfying a line of its 
    attributes in a query, an object is considered as queried. </p>
  <p>- These observations are important when the input data is filtered by queried, 
    not queried, grouped, and not grouped. </p> </font> </div>
