    <span style='font-size: 13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Areas Regionalization: The 
    Skater Method</span> </u></strong> </font></p>
  <div align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <p>TerraView provides a tool for area regionalization to group small areas 
      (such as municipalities and neighborhoods) in larger contiguous areas where 
      associated attributes are similar to the small areas (such as homicides 
      and kidnappings). TerraView tool for this task is the SKATER tool. </p>
    <p>Skater is a cluster analysis that considers the spatial localization of objects. 
      It is applied when a map is partitioned in areas, each one with a given 
      geographic localization, and areas with similar characteristics must be 
      part of the same spatial grouping. The characteristics are obtained by values 
      of measured variables.</p>
    <p>When a spatial pattern is visualized, it is useful to make objective considerations 
      such as: if the observed pattern is random or if there is a cluster defined. 
      Also if the distribution is associated to measurable causes or if there 
      are clusters different patterns in the study region. </p>
    <p>This method may be applied, for instance, to define geographic areas that 
      are relatively homogeneous for a given type of crimes by aggregating municipalities 
      in larger groups. These groups of municipalities may be affected by public 
      policies targeting regional problems. In addition to the direct observations 
      and actions that crimes regionalization allow, it is also an important tool 
      for the analysis of related social and economic factors related to crimes 
      distribution. Therefore, the identification of spatial patterns in the incidence 
      of homicides leads immediately to the reflection of causal factors responsible 
      for this spatial allocation.</p>
    <p>The figure below presents Minas Gerais State divided in eleven spatial clusters 
      shaped by homicides homogeneity. The legend allows the identification of 
      the average rate of homicides in each region and the number of municipalities 
      included in each cluster (inside parentheses).</p>
  <p align=center><img border=0 src="terraViewBase_arquivos/mapa_bhzonte.png"></p>
    <p>The regionalization was executed considering homogeneity criteria and contiguity 
      restrictions through statistics methods based on regression trees and minimum 
      spanning trees. </p>
    <p>SKATER generates spatial clusters that are disjoint subsets of one or more areas, 
      in such way that an area that is contained in a given cluster is neighbor 
      of, at least, another area of the same cluster. Two regions are neighbors 
      if they share geographic boundaries. Some databases may contain areas with 
      neighborhood identification problems and the analysis is not viable. In 
      such case the following error message is displayed: Select a connected graph. </p>
    <p>BH.mdb database presents the problem described above (except for UPs), as can be 
      seen in the Figure below, which presents an area selected from Batalhões 
      theme.</p>
  <p align=center><img border=0 id="_x0000_i1034" src="terraViewBase_arquivos/bancoBH_mdb.png"></p>
  <p>Zooming in the selected region, it is possible to see that the polygon boundaries are 
     not identifiable and SKATER cannot create the clusters. </p>
  <p align=center><img border=0 src="terraViewBase_arquivos/skater.png"></p>
  <p>To be able to execute the analysis, Ups will be used. A UP (Planning Unit) 
     corresponds to the grouping of areas as utilized by Belo Horizonte prefecture. </p>
  <p>SKATER method allows the use of various social-economic characteristics 
      simultaneously in the regionalization process, in a similar way to a composed 
      indicator. This indicator type is used to delimit health risk areas. The 
      indicator corresponds to measures associating various different social-economic 
      and environmental variables to a synthetic indicator used to analyze the 
      characteristics of population groups living in given geographic areas. </p>
   <p>Activate UP theme of data BH.mdb database to create a map where the areas 
      (the UPs), are clustered accordingly to values of variables of columns: 
      banheiro_p, densidade_p agua_p, esgoto_p, lixo_p, and rendamedia_p.</p>
   <p>Description of the variables:</p>

  <ol>
      <li>
        banheiro (bathroom): proportion of households with 4 or more bathrooms 
        in relation to households that have a bathroom. </li>
      <li> 
        densidade: expected number of residents per household. </li>
	  <li>
        água: proportion of individual permanent households with water supply 
        from the network. </li>
      <li>
        esgoto: proportion of individual permanent households with bathroom 
        or toilet - domestic sewage - connected to sewage or pluvial network. </li>
      <li>
        lixo: proportion of individual permanent households - garbage destination 
        -  collected by garbage service.</li>
      <li>
        rendamedia: the average income of the head of the household.</li>
  </ol>
      <p>The variables are standardized (banheiro_p...) due to the impact different 
        scales may have in the dissimilarity function and in the sum of squares 
        in the clusters. For instance, a variable hold the same information either 
        it is measured as percentage or as proportion. However, values difference 
        of this hypothetic variable is 100 times. Therefore, it is advisable that 
        all variables to be used for regionalization to have a standard scale 
        with mean zero and standard deviation one. This requirement can be checked 
        by activating the popup menu of any variable label and selecting the Statistics 
        option. The standardization can be obtained by subtracting the original 
        value by the average and dividing by the standard deviation.</p>
      <p>To build the regionalized map use the spatial statistics tool SKATER from 
        Analysis option in TerraView main menu. Description of the SKATER interface 
        is given below: </p>
      <p>1. Choose the criteria to define the number of larger regions (groups) to 
        be created in Aggregation Method field. Groups option allows the definition 
        of a fixed number and Population option allows the definition of a minimum 
        population for each group. For minimum population, inform where data is 
        in Population Data Selection field. Select Groups and type in 10 as the 
        population value. </p>
      <p>2. Choose which theme will be grouped in Theme Selection field. Select UP 
        theme.</p>
      <p>3. In Results field, define the table and the column name where the cluster 
        a region belongs to. Standard option is ska, but it can be changed. </p>
      <p>4. In Attribute Selection field, select the information to be used to calculate 
        similarity among areas, such as number of homicides by area, mean income 
        by area, etc. Theme Attributes list displays all allowed attributes (numeric) 
        and Attributes Selected list displays the selected attributes fro clustering. 
        Select UP.rendamedia_p, UP.banheiro_p, UP.água_p, UP.densidade_p, UP.esgoto_p, 
        and UP.lixo_p.</p>
      <p>5. Execute the procedure to create the larger regions.</p>
  <p align=center><img border=0 src="terraViewBase_arquivos/arvore_geradora.png"></p>
  <p>Observe that a new column ska was created in UP table with the group that each area 
    belongs to. A graph displaying queda de desvios is also created automatically 
    and is shown in Figure below. To visualize the areas in the active map, a 
    thematic map using unique value on the new column must be created. </p>
  <p align=center> <span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img border=0 id="_x0000_i1031" src="terraViewBase_arquivos/arvore_geradora_minima.png"> 
    </font></span></p>
  <p>Analysis of reduction of desvio interno indicates the best number of clusters to be 
    created. There is a large reduction at the start when the number is small. 
    From a given point the reduction becomes smaller, indicating that the creation 
    of more clusters does not increase significantly the internal homogeneity 
    of each cluster.</p>
   <p><strong>Results Visualization</strong> </p>
   <p>Figures presents the procedure that creates the visualization of UP map clustered 
    by values of columns: banheiro_p , densidade_p, água_p, esgoto_p, lixo_p,
