      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Global Moran Index</strong></font></p>
      <p>This index is used to identify the spatial correlation structure that best describes 
        the data. The basic principle is to characterize the spatial dependency by showing how 
        values are spatially correlated. In a general way, Moran index is useful to test if 
        the null hypothesis is that there is spatial dependency; in this case the value is 
        zero. Positive values (between 0 and +1) indicate a direct correlation and negative 
        values (between 0 and -1) indicate inverse correlation. Once the index is calculate, 
        it is important to statistically validate it. </p>
      <p>Activate UP Theme with BH.mdb open. In the menu bar, select the <b>Analysis</b> - 
        <b>Spatial Statistics</b>. 
        The Spatial Statistics window will be displayed, as shown in the figure below.</p>

      <p><font face="Arial">1. Define the <b>Attribute</b> for which the presence of local 
        spatial correlation must be tested. Select the attribute homicides in year 2003 (HOM_03).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">2. Activate the <b>Moran Index</b> option.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">3. To evaluate the significance of the index, select 99 permutations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">4. Click on <b>OK</b> to execute the procedure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">5. Test result will be shown in the <b>Index Value</b> and <b>p-value</b> 
        fields.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>It can be verified that there is no spatial autocorrelation in the Homicides in year 2003 
        since the Moran index value is 0.105837, with 0.12 significance. A small index value and a 
        significance value over 0.05, indicates that the hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation can 
        not be rejected.<br>
        A visual analysis can also be executed using a Thematic Map. 
        For instance, select five equal steps for the focus attribute in the <b>Edit Legend</b> 
        option on the UP Theme popup menu.<br>
      </p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/estatistica_espacial1.png" width="501" height="405"></p>
      <p>If there were spatial autocorrelation, it can be expected that, areas with greater 
        (smaller) proportions of homicides were closer to each other. However, the map 
        above shows that this does not happen, since no clear pattern can be observed.</p>
      <p>To practice with an example where there is spatial autocorrelation, 
        follow the steps above using the Mean Income (rendamedia) attribute.<br>
        After the procedure is applied, it can be verified that there is spatial autocorrelation 
        with the Mean Income attribute, since the Moran index value is 0.446818, with 
        0.01 significance value.</p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Local Moran Index - LISA</strong></font></p>
      <p>Global autocorrelation indicators, such as Moran index, provide one value as 
        the measure of spatial association for the whole study region dataset. 
        However, in many cases it is desirable to analyze patterns in a scale with more 
        details to verify if the hypothesis of stationarity of the process is valid locally.<br>
        To verify the hypothesis, it is necessary to use spatial association indicators that can be 
        associated to different location of a spatially distributed variable. 
        This methodology uses the Local Moran Index to find spatial correlation in these areas. 
        Given that it is a local indicator, there is a specific correlation value for each area.</p>
      <p>Activate UP Theme with the BH.mdb database open. In the menu bar, select <b>Analysis</b> - 
        <b>Spatial Statistics</b>. A new window will be displayed, as shown in 
          the following figure.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/estatistica_espacial2.png" width="338" height="478"></p>
      <p>1. Define the <b>Attribute</b> for which the presence of local spatial 
        correlation must be tested. Select rendamedia (mean income).</p>
      <p>2. Activate the <b>Local Moran Index (LISA)</b> option.</p>
      <p>3. To test the significance of the index, select 99 permutations.</p>
      <p>4. Insert the <b>Prefix of the column to be generated</b>. Type in RENDA.</p>
      <p>5. Click on <b>OK</b> to execute the procedure.</p>
      <p>The following columns are created:</p>
      <p>- <b>Z</b>: Vector with observed deviations.<br>
      </p>
      <p>- <b>Wz</b>: Local weighted average vector.<br>
      </p>
      <p>- <b>MoranIndex</b>: Local Moran Index.<br>
      </p>
      <p>- <b>LISASig</b>: Value of the p statistics. In the given example, 
        if the value is greater than 0.05 we may assume that there is no autocorrelation 
        and it is significant.</p>
      <p>- <b>BoxMap</b>: Presented values correspond to the relation between Z 
        and Wz values in a Dispersion Plot divided by quadrants (Q). Values range 
        from 1 to 4, where 1 corresponds to values in Q1 (high-high – high Z and 
        Wz values), 2 (Q2, low-low), 3 (Q3, high-low), and 4 (Q4, low-high). 
        In the study case, if the deviations vector (Z) and the averages vectors 
        (Wz) are high – case of the Q1 quadrant - it may be assumed that it is an 
        UP with high average income surrounded by other UPs in the same situation; 
        and if it is Q2, the UP has low average income and is surrounded by UPs in 
        the same situation.<br>
        Cases Q3 and Q4 detect Ups with high and low incomes located near UPs with 
        lower and higher incomes, respectively. 
        Note that this type of study only divides UPs in two groups in relation to 
        average income (high and low).</p>
      <p>- <b>LISAMap</b>: This column values, ranging from 0 to 4, are created 
        only if a level of significance is selected in the interface.<br>
        During the creation of a LISAMap, local indices are classified as: 
        non significant (0) or significant with confidence 95% (1, p=0.05), 99% (2, p=0.01) 
        and 99,9% (3, p=0.001).</p>
      <p>- <b>MoranMap</b>: This column values are generated only if a level of significance 
        is selected in the interface. This result presents only regions where <i>Ii</i> values 
        are significant (interval above 95%) while BoxMap does not consider significance. 
        In this case, local indices <i>Ii</i> are associated to the Moran dispersion diagram.<br>
        The values are: 0 (non significant), 1 – Q1 (high-high), 2 – Q2 (low-low), 
        3 – Q3 (high-low), 4 – Q4 (low-high)..<br>

      <p>Spatial Local Mean method examines the mean value <i>mi</i> of an attribute in 
        the study region (first order).</p>

	  <p>1. Define the <b>Attribute</b> for which the presence of local spatial correlation 
	must be tested. Select the rendamedia attribute.</p>
      <p>2. Activate the <b>Local Mean</b> option.</p>
      <p>3. Evaluate the test significance by selecting 99 permutations.</p>
      <p>4. Insert the <b>Prefix of the column to be generated</b>. Type in RendaMedia.</p>
      <p>Create a legend using Quantil mode to produce a Thematic Map with the generated column.</p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>G and G* Functions</strong></font></p>
      <p>G and G* functions are two local spatial autocorrelation indices that allow the 
        test of hypotheses about the spatial clustering of the values sum, associated to 
        the neighbors points to the considered one. <br>
        Since this indicators are composed by the sum of attributes values, the observation 
        of significant high values of Gi and Gi*  indicates that this attributes occur in 
        high values, and the opposite indicates clustering of low values. <br>
        The main difference between G and G* functions is that the former considers values 
        of all neighbors while the later considers the region to calculate the index.<br>

      <p>5. Click on <b>OK</b> to execute the procedure.</p>
      <p>A new column will be created with the values of the G function. With this 
        estimation, a Thematic Map can be created.<br>
        Follow the steps presented above, but using the G* option. <br>
