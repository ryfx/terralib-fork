<strong>What is Geocoding?</strong>
<br><br>
The purpose of Geocoding is to locate point data in a Geographic Information System (SIG). Geocoding is the procedure that associates a geographic coordinate to an event based on a layer (data layer with geographic information, which is with geometry and attributes) with addresses to be found. Once an address is associated to a location, the address can be used to visualize events on a map and for analysis.
<br><br>
TerraLib method to compute the location is based on addresses interpolation and follow the steps presented below:
<ol>
<li>The location is defined from the layer with street segments containing the range of addresses on each side of the segment.
</li>
<li>When the segment with the address number is found, its location is estimated based on the segment length. The percentage an address number represents in the range of number for the segment defines its location (Figure 1).
</li>
</ol>

<strong>How to geocode addresses in a table using TerraView</strong>
<br><br>
Geocoding of addresses table (Figure 2) is one method to spatialize table information by creating a layer with a geographic location (represented by points) associated to attributes table with addresses.

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="spatializationStack1"></a>To geocode a table, execute the following steps: </font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<ol>
<li>In &quot;File&quot; menu, select &quot;Address Geocoding...&quot; option (Figure 3).
<p align=center><br>

<br>

<br><br>
</p>
</li>
<li>In the next interface (Figure 4), select the layer to be used as reference for geocoding, that is, select the layer with streets (or street segments). In the first step, verify if the layer has been previously configured to be presented in the items list. If not, configure the layer using &quot;Configure...&quot; button.

<br><br>
</p>
</li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="lbsDefinition"></a>Configuration step presents a new interface (Figure 5) where the following parameters are selected:
<br><br>
	<strong>a.</strong> Table fields with attributes that correspond to the initial and final number of segments;
	<br><br>
	<strong>b.</strong> Structure of segment address, which may be divided in more than one table field, for instance, in fields TYPE (type: Avenue, Street, Lane...), TITLE (title: Sir, Doctor...), PREPOSITION (preposition: of...) and NOME (name: MARIA CLARA, JOAO GILBERTO...).
	<br><br>
	<strong>c.</strong> Field with full name of the segment (the system will ask if the user wants to convert field characters to capital letters <a name=fntref1></a> <a href="#fnt1">[1]</a>. If there is no such field, it can be created by providing a name. The new column will be composed by the values of the fields with segment address.
	<br><br>
	<strong>d.</strong> Two additional fields, one with neighborhoods (sectors, districts...) and another with postal codes.
	<br><br>
	Click &quot;Confirm&quot; button after the fields are selected. Fields can be changed and will be updated by clicking the same
button. To remove the reference layer, click &quot;Remove&quot; button.
	<br><br>
	Once a layer is configured, the previous steps are not required when using the same layer in new geocodings, even if the geocoding interface or TerraView is closed).

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="spatializationStack2"></a>After the reference layer has been selected, click &quot;Next&quot; button to inform the table with addresses to be geocoded and the address fields in the table (Figure 6).

<ul>
It is not required that all the fields are present as they are in the reference layer, however it is advisable that the segment name has &quot;similar&quot;<a name=fntref2></a> format <a href="#fnt2">[2]</a>.
<br><br>
In addition to tables that are already in the database (BD), tables can be imported tables into the database. If the table is in the
BD and does not appear in the list, select the table in database import interface and select another name for it.
<br><br>
</ul>
</font></li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="spatializationStack3"></a>A dictionary may be used during addresses search in the segments set (Figure 7). The contents of the dictionary must be words in the segments set that are typed in a different way in the addresses table.
<br>
<ul><br>
Example: Addresses table may contain the following expression: RUA CÔNEGO CASSIANO and segments set contains R CON. CASSIANO. If there 
         are dictionary entries with words RUA and R, and CÔNEGO and CON., the search will be more precise.
<br><br>
The dictionary, in ASCII format, has the following structure:
	<ul>
		&quot;AV&quot;, &quot;AV.&quot;, &quot;AVN&quot; ,&quot;AVENIDA&quot;
		<br><br>
		&quot;CON.&quot;, &quot;CÔNEGO&quot;
		<br><br>
		&quot;PALAVRA&quot;, &quot;PAL.&quot;, &quot;PALAVR&quot;,&quot;PLVR&quot;
		<br><br>
		&quot;R&quot;, &quot;RUA&quot;, &quot;R.&quot;
	</ul>
<br>
The first word will be used as reference to the other words in the line. In the example above, occurrences of &quot;RUA&quot; and &quot;R.&quot; could be <a name=fntref3></a> <a href="#fnt3">[3]</a> replaced by &quot;R&quot; in the search.
