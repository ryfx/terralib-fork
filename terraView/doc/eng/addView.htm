      <p>A View is used to define which information from different layers must be visualized
        or manipulated together. Since each layer may have a different projection, 
        the View also defines in which projection the manipulation will be executed.
        Notice that the non-cartographic coordinates system (&ldquo;NoProjection&rdquo;) can not 
        be remapped, and therefore, Layers &ldquo;NoProjection&rdquo; can not be overlaid with Layers with cartographic 
        projection. <br>

      <p>1. To create a View, select <b>View - Add</b>.</p>
      <p>2. Type in a name for the new View and click on <b>OK</b> button.</p>
      <p>Right-click on a View to query its projection, properties, and to execute operations on 
      this View, such as Rename and Remove, among others.  </p>
