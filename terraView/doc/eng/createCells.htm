      <hr>
      <p>A layer of cells is created from another layer. TerraView has two strategies 
        to create cells depending on the type of spatial data of the input layer. If the type 
        is raster or another geometry that is not polygonal, the cells will be created 
        from the bounding box of the layer. In this case, cells will cover the whole extents 
        of the layer, in a way similar to a raster data, with a constant number of cells in 
        each row and column of the layer. If the type of the data is polygonal, the 
        cells will be created in a way that covers the polygons, but cells will be created only 
        where there is an intersection between a polygon and a created cell. </p>
      <p> When menu item <b>Layer</b> - <b>Create Cells</b> is clicked or the context menu 
        on the layer name is clicked and the Create Cells option is selected, the interface shown 
        in the figure below will be displayed.</p>

      <p>1. Select the reference <b>Layer</b> or <b>Theme</b> to create the cells layer. Observe 
        that the interface ticks the <b>Polygons</b> option if it finds out that the selected 
        layer has this representation.</p>
      <p>2. The fields related to <b>Bounding Box</b> are filled in based on the dimension of 
        the selected layer or theme.</p>
      <p>3. In <b>New Layer</b> field, fill in <b>Res. X</b> and <b>Res. Y</b> based on 
        the reference layer scale and on the number and size of the cells to be created. 
        Type in a <b>Name</b> for the new cells layer.</p>
      <p>4. Click on <b>OK</b>. A warning message will be displayed to inform the number of columns 
        and of rows of the cells layer to be created. Click on <b>Yes</b> to confirm. 
        This operation may take a long time  depending on the selected layer size and the number 
        of cells to be created.</p>
      <p>When the operation is finished, the new layer with cells has been created. Create a 
        theme using this layer to visualize it in the Draw Area.</p>
      <p>Figure below presents the difference between the use of polygonal and raster data when 
        creating a cells layer.
