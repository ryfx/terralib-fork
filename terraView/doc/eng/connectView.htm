      <p>"Connect View" tool allows the user to visualize two views of a database with different geographic 
      information of the same region simultaneously. To connect, select the themes to visualize, 
      as presented in the previous lessons, and choose a second view later, which will have its previously 
      selected themes visualized through the connected window in the Draw Area.</p>
      <p>This resource allows, for instance, the comparison of two images of different dates 
      on the same region to verify the changes occurred in a time interval.<br>
Follow these steps:</p>
    <p>In the <u>geocover</u> view, select the <u>geocover</u> theme and display it in the Draw Area. </p>

       <p><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/conectar_tabela.png"></p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
     </center>
     <p>2.	Make sure that the TM_5 view has the selected theme, as shown in the figure, given that 
     the contents of this view will be visualized in the connected window.
    </p>
    <p>3.	Right-click on the geocover view to enable the popup menu and select the Connect option.</p></td>
