<p align="justify"><strong>Which is the drawing order of the themes ticked for visualization?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">Themes are drawn in the inverse order of their position in the current view 
  list, that is, from bottom to top. Therefore, the last drawn themes will overlay on the 
  already drawn ones and are located above them in the list of themes of a view.</p>
  </br>
  <p align="justify"> 
  The only exception is the current (or active) theme, which will be the last drawn, regardless 
  of its position in the tree.
 
  This exception is justified given that the current themes is the one with attributes shown in 
  the grid, and therefore, it must be always visible to allow the interaction between grid and draw 
  area.</p>
  </br>
  When a theme overlay is an issue, there are two solutions:
   <ul>
    <li> 
	<p align="justify"> 
  change their positions in the themes list of the view, moving the covered theme to 
  an upper position; this can be executed by dragging themes in the list using the mouse;</p></li>
    <li> 
	<p align="justify">
  select the covered theme as the current (or active) theme, ensuring that it will be the last 
  drawn;</p></li>
    <li> 
	<p align="justify">	 
  sometimes the previous solutions are not appropriate if both themes must be visualized 
  simultaneously; in this case, change the visual of the covering theme to increase its 
  transparency;</p></li> 
</ul>
