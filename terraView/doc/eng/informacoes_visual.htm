      <hr>
      <p>When a map is created, it is drawn with the default visual, which can be changed 
        at any time. In TerraView, the default visual can be changed by user choice. 
        TerraView allows changing the default visual of polygons (or cells), lines, points, 
        and text. <br>
        The default visual defines the visual characteristics of a map when no analysis 
        has been executed, that is, it is a map where all polygons, lines, points 
        and texts are drawn with the visual of their representations. 
        The most simple type of object highlighting is to define a own visual to an object. <br>
        In TerraView, own visuals are defined over the representations using 
        default visual. This means that own visual has higher priority than default visual. 
        Therefore, an object with own visual will be drawn with its own visual instead of 
        being drawn with the default visual. Once the own visual is removed, 
        representations will be drawn with the default visual. 
        This feature is relevant if the user wants to highlight objects with an important 
        characteristic.<br>
        The next visual in priority order in TerraView is the grouping visual. 
        This visual overwrites own visual and default visual. In TerraView, every time 
        a grouping is executed, own visual are lost temporaly. Own visuals exist only when there is no 
        grouping (legend). When objects are ungrouped, their representations recover their 
        default visual or own visual for drawing. 
        <br>
        Query visual is used to highlight objects selected by the query module. 
        Query visual changes only the color of selected objects. Objects are drawn keeping the 
        same style, size, and type of the representations. 
        Therefore, if a selected object is drawn in default visual 
        by a crosshatched polygon, this polygon will be drawn using the same crosshatch with 
        the color defined by the query visual. If an object is drawn using grouping visual, 
        this object will be drawn using the style, size, and type defined by the grouping 
        visual, with the color changed to the color of the query visual. The concept is to allow 
        the user to be able to visualize which objects satisfy the restriction, independent 
        from the fact of the object being grouped or not. <br>
        Highlighting is also applied to the lines of the table in order to enable the user 
        to verify the attributes of objects selected by the query. <br>
        Removal of the query will make the map to be drawn using the visuals of the object 
        previous to the query. That is, TerraView retrieves the map as it was drawn before 
        the query. The table will also be drawn as it was before the query. <br>
        Pointing visual changes only the color of the pointed object and keeps other previous 
        characteristics. In this case, it does not matter if the 
        pointed object was drawn using the default, own, grouping, or query visual. 
        The concept is to allow the user to visualize the pointed 
        object. <br>
        Pointing can be made from table to map and from map to table. 
        In the first case, by pointing to the characteristics on the table, 
        the user can find out where the object is located on the map and discover 
        its shape, neighborhood, etc. In the second case, 
        by pointing to a representation on the map, the user 
        can discover, on the table, which are its characteristics. 
        <br>
        Finally, TerraView defines a visual to distinguish where the intersections 
        between pointing and query at the same time are. That is, which are the objects that are 
        selected by a query and pointed at the same time. 
        <br>
        Every object, independent of the executed query, will have its 
        line in the grid (table) highlighted, with the same color of the representation 
        (polygon, line, point) being used in the Draw Area.</p>
