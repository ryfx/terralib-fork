  <p>Object labels are texts used for visually identifying objects. They can be created using a 
    tool available in <em>TerraView</em>. Refer to the <a href="FAQ_gerandoTexto.htm">How to create 
    text linked to a layer attribute?</a> <br>  	
	
  <p>To <u>relocate</u> a label, select the <b>E</b> icon 
    (Theme Edition) in the toolbar, and the pointing cursor (arrow). In the next step, select 
    the label by placing the arrow cursor on it, clicking and keeping the mouse left button down. 
    Note that the cursor changes from arrow to cross; keep the mouse button down and drag the 
    mouse on the label to create a square or a rectangle and then release the mouse button. 
    After confirming that the label is selected, place the mouse on its center until a small 
    hand is displayed, drag it by clicking with the mouse left button and move it to the place of
    choice. Release the mouse button to finish.</p>
  <p>To <u>remove</u> a label, select it using the previous procedure and click on the Delete key 
    of the keyboard.. </p>
  <p>To <u>change the size</u> of a label, repeat the previous selection procedure and 
  	place the cursor at the label edge. Note that the cursor changes to an arrow. Click on it 
  	with the mouse left button and drag it slowly to increase and decrease the label size. Release 
  	the button to finish.
  </p>
        <u>Note 1</u> : The label selection operation can be executed to include many labels at 
        once by defining an area that covers all labels you want to select. This selection is 
        executed by left-clicking with the mouse and dragging it when the cursor is cross shaped.
        With this procedure, <u>it is possible to relocate, remove and change the size of many 
        labels at once</u>.
  </p>
<br>
  </p>
        <u>Note 2</u> : Size change is not available for labels created using the "Fixed Size" 
        option for text visual. This constraint lasts even if the option is deselectd after the 
        labels are created.
