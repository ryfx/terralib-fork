  <p align=center><strong><u><span style='font-size: 13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Creation 
    of Distance Zones or Buffers</span></u></strong> </p>
  <p>A buffer or distance zone is an area around 
  an object with a fixed distance from it. Some examples of buffer are shown in 
  Figure 1.</p>

    Figure 1 - Examples of distance zone or buffer </p>
  <p>The interface to create buffers or distance zones is shown in Figure 2. This 
    interface creates a new layer with all buffers created from the objects of 
    an input theme and a given distance. To activate the interface, use the context 
    menu on a View, and <strong>Geoprocessing – Create Buffers</strong> option. 
  </p>

    Figure 2 - Create buffers interface </p>
  <p>The interface has 6 parts: </p>
  <p>1. <strong>Input</strong>: used to define the input theme and which theme objects 
  are considered (all, pointed only, or queried only. </p>
  <p>2. <strong>Distance</strong>: used to define a fixed distance for all objects 
  or to select the numeric attribute which defines specific distances for each 
  object. </p>
  <p>IMPORTANT: the distance unit MUST be the same of the data. For instance, if 
  data unit is decimal degrees, the distance must be also in decimal degrees; 
  if the unit is meters, the distance must be in meters, and so on. To check which 
  is the input theme unit, verify the base layer projection of the theme. </p>
  <p>3. <strong>Multiple Levels</strong>: different buffer levels based on a distance 
  <b><i>d</i></b> can be created. Therefore, each level <b><i>n</i></b> buffer 
  corresponds to a distance buffer between <b><i>d*(n-1)</i></b> and <b><i>d*n</i></b>. 
  In Figure 3, 3 buffer levels were created around Minas Gerais state borders, 
  considering a 7000 meters distance. The first level is a 7000 meters buffer. 
  The second level corresponds to a distance buffer between 7000 and 14000 meters. 
  And finally, the third level corresponds to a distance buffer between 14000 
  and 21000 meters. </p>

    Figure 3 - Multiple levels </p>
  <p>4. <strong>Dissolve Barriers Between Buffers</strong>: each computed buffer 
  for each object of an input theme creates a new object in the output layer. 
  Depending on the selected distance, the output layermay contain overlapping 
  objects. If dissolve barriers between barriers option is selected, all overlapping 
  objects in the output layer are joined in a single object. This operation is 
  shown in Figure 4. </p>

    <br>
    Figure 4 - Dissolve barriers between buffers </p>
  <p>The input theme is shown in Figure 4.a. The output layer created without dissolving 
  barriers between buffers is shown in Figure 4.b. Observe that each buffer created 
  one object in the output layer (buffer_1, buffer_2 and buffer_3) and that they 
  overlap. The output layer created by dissolving barriers between buffers is 
  shown in Figure 4.c. In this case, the output layer is created with one object 
  only (buffer_1), resulting from the union of all created buffers. </p>
  <p>5. <strong>Rule To Polygon Case</strong>: this part of the interface is enabled 
  when the geometric representation of the input layer is polygonal. Three types 
  of buffer can be selected: Only Inside, Inside and Outside, and Only Outside. 
  Figure 5 shows each type of buffer. Figure 5.a shows a buffer created with only 
  the inside region of Minas Gerais state, Figure 5.b shows a buffer created with 
  only the outside region, and Figure 5.c shows a buffer created with inside and 
  outside regions. </p>

  <p>6. <strong>Output</strong>: used to define the output layer name.&nbsp;the created 
  layer will contain the buffers and and a static table with distance and level 
  of each buffer. </p>
