    <span style='font-size: 13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Aggregation Method</span></u></strong></font></p>

    <p>Aggregation operation uses n objects as input to create one object in the 
    output. Every new object has only one record in the attributes table and is 
    usually presented by many geometries. For instance, a map of Brazil represented 
    by its 5505 municipalities (excluding islands) can be used to create a map 
    with states by aggregating municipality polygons and obtaining the 27 Brazilian 
    states. </p>
    <p>The layer resulting from the operation (states map) has geometries and table 
    attributes created from an aggregating attribute (column with states identification 
    in a municipalities table) selected in the input theme. This operation creates 
    one object (polygon representing one state) for each distinct value of this 
    attribute and each created object contains the summary of the attributes in 
    the input theme.</p>
    <p>In the example below, UP (Planning Units for Belo Horizonte city) theme will 
    be transformed in a new theme representing Administrative Districts of the 
    city. UP table has 62 lines, each line corresponding to one of the 62 polygons 
    representing Planning Units. The table has also a column named Id_Dist that 
    represents the identification for each Administrative District. Belo Horizonte 
    city has 9 Administrative Districts, each one containing a given number of 
    Planning Units.</p>
    <p>Aggregation geographic operation will create a new theme that can be used 
    to visualize how Belo Horizonte city is divided in Administrative Districts. 
    An important characteristic of aggregation procedure is that the user can 
    choose attributes and how these attributes will be available in the output 
    theme table. </p>

  <p>1. Define the theme with attributes to be aggregated;</p>
  <p>2. Define table attribute with the information used for aggregation;</p>
  <p>3. Select the name of the theme created by the aggregation;</p>
  <p>4. Select the attributes to be transferred to aggregated table and the aggregation operation (sum, mean, median, count, etc...)</p>
  <p>The maps below illustrate the aggregation procedure.</p>
