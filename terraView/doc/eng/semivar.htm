             Semivariogram is the core of geo-statistics studies and describes, at the same time, 
             qualitatively and quantitatively the spatial variation. In addition, it is key to 
             defining the kriging geo-statistical predictor. Therefore, it is important to adjust 
             and select the models of the semivariogram function.
             <br /><br /> Semivariogram is often used to define the spatial variability structure 
             and the amplitude of the spatial dependency of the study variables. 
             Basically, the semivariogram measures the similarity degree between neighbor samples, 
             with the expectation that the closer they are, the greater their similarity; therefore 
             the variance will be smaller and, as the distance increases, the similarity will decrease, 
             until it will be random.
	<br /><br /> The semivariogram allows the definition of the amplitude of the temporal-spatial 
	  dependency of random regionalized variables, which, when the temporal-spatial dependency 
	  exists, the estimations are executed with more precision using geo-statistics techniques than 
	  with classic statistics.
