  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A raster is composed by a set of points, called &quot;pixels&quot;, organized 
        as rows and columns. A scanner captures an image and assigns a row, a column, and a color value 
        (black and white, gray level, or color) to each point. Satellite images and aerial 
        photographs are examples of raster data.<br>
        TerraView imports the following file types: TIF, JPG, RAW, and TXT. To import, execute 
        these steps:</font></p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<p>1. Click on the menu <b>File - Raster Import</b> as shown in the Figure below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/importar_raster.png"> <BR>
  <i>Access to raster import through the Menu</i></p>
<p>2. The <b>Raster Import</b> interface will be displayed as shown in the Figure below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/importar_raster1.png"> <BR>
  <i>Initial Raster Import interface</i></p>
<p>3. Use <b>File</b> button to indicate where the image is stored and click on <b>Open</b> button.</p>
<p>4. Once the raster image to be imported is selected, the number of <b>Rows</b> and 
  <b>Columns</b> will be presented. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/importar_raster2.png"> <br>
    <i>Interface after choosing the image input file</i></p>
<p><b>Dummy</b> parameter is optional and, if defined, indicates the pixel value considered 
  to be transparent, that is, no information is attached to it. During import, 
  the pixel value will be mapped to the output <b>Dummy</b> value, the one considered 
  transparent in the image stored in the database. Pixels with this value will not be drawn 
  in the Draw Area.</p>
<p>5. Click on <b>Next</b> button to move to the next window, as shown in the Figure below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/importar_raster3.png"><br />
  <i>Geographical Characteristics interface</i></p>
<p>6. This window presents information extracted from the input raster file, and also after 
      having changed the projection, as explained below.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i> -  The projection information may sometimes not be the one of the image in the input 
    file. If possible, get the correct projection information from the image provider.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. If the presented projection is not the correct one, change it by clicking on <b>Projection</b>,
    providing the correct parameters of the projection and clicking on OK to return to the Geographical 
	Characteristics interface.</p>
<p>8. When the projection is correct, click on <b>Next</b> button. The interface in the Figure 
  below will be shown.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="terraViewBase_arquivos/importar_raster4.png"><br /> 
  <i>Storage Characteristics interface</i></p>
<p>9. Fill in other items as presented in the sequence:</p>
<p> -  <b>Name</b>: if a new layer is going to be created, its name must be typed in. If the 
  layer already exists, select it from the presented list of layers. The last case occurs when 
  a mosaic is beeing create using a second file;</p>
<p> -  <b>Object Id</b>: currently this field must not be filled in;</p>
<p> -  <b>Compression</b>: to be applied before data is stored to reduce the physical space 
  and can be: none, zlib, or jpeg. Jpeg compression is the most efficient, although it can not 
  be applied to pallete type images;<br>
</p>
<p> -  <b>Width and Height</b> define the size of data block used in storage; recommended 
  value is 512 x 512;</p>
<p> - <b>Dummy</b>: defines the transparent value, as mentioned before. This value is 
  suggested by the import interface using the same value defined for the input image, 
  presented in the interface shown in step 4, and detailed in the text that follows the 
  figure;</p>
<p> -  <b>Expansible</b>: must be used when various files create one image, that is, when a 
  mosaic is being created and this is the first imported file.</p>
<p>10. Click on <b>Next</b>, to proceed to the next step regarding multiresolution, 
  or click on <b>Finish</b> button to start the import.</p>
<p>11. The optional multiresolution step intends to enhance image visualization performance, by using  
      a pyramid with several images obtained from the original image using different resolutions, the higher 
	  the resolution the closer to the bottom of the it.
	  The highest resolution corresponds to the original image in the input file, which will be 
	  always imported at the bottom of the pyramid (level 0).</p>
<p>The following parameters about pyramid must be set:</p>
<p> -  <b>Number of </b>(additional resolution)<b> Levels</b> to be used in the pyramid. This value depends on the application and 
  visualization scale usually used. If the scale is much smaller than the image original one, 
  this value must be high (for instance, 10);</p>
<p> - Select the additional levels in the list at right: initially the list is shown with the provided number of levels already
      selected, which are consecutive and starting from level 1. This choice is recommended, but it is possible to select any levels,
	  even if they are not consecutive and in a quantity which is different from the number provided before.
