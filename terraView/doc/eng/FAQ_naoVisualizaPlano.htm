<p align="justify">A theme, assuming that it is ticked for visualization, will not be visualized 
   in two cases:	
</p>
<div align="justify">
  <ol>
    <li> 
	<p align="justify">The layer was imported with no defined projection 
	   ("No Projection") and later a theme was created from this layer in a view with a 
	   defined projection (for instance UTM). This theme will not be visualized since it can not 
	   be georefered, that is spatially located. To georefer, the corresponding layer must 
	   have a defined projection. If a layer projection is defined and it is different from the 
	   view projection, then the coordinates of every object of the layer will be converted 
	   to the coordinates of the view during the theme visualization. </p></li>
    <li> <p align="justify">The layer was imported with a defined projection 
      (for instance UTM), and a theme was created form this layer in a view without a defined 
      projection ("No Projection"). In this case, the themes to be visualized are the ones 
      ticked for visualization linked to layers without a defined projection (that is, 
      with "No Projection").</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p align="justify">The following table summarizes when a Theme is or is not visualized 
    depending on the Layer and View projections: </p>
