  between themes with geometric representation of polygons type. It is used to 
  remove whole objects or parts of its geometry. In the following example, input 
  theme Tema1 representing Brazil municipalities and theme Tema2 with clip area 
  are operated. The difference operation removes all municipalities contained 
  in Tema2ellipsoidal region. Municipalities partially contained are not removed, 
  but their geometries are clipped by the Tema2 ellipses. Figure 1 shows Tema2 
  overlaid on Tema1, before the difference operation. </font>
