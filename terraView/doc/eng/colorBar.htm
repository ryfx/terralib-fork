		Figure 1 shows a color bar with a grade in red. The grade shown in the bar was produced from two primary colors put on each extreme. On the left side, red was placed and on the right, dark red was placed. The colors produced in the bar are the result of a gradual mix that goes from red to dark red.

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The colors used in 
    a grouping are generated from this bar. The criterion is to divide the bar 
    into n groups to produce the necessary n colors. For example, for a legend 
    with three groups the colors produced in this case will be: </font> </p>
  <ul>
		- <img id="_x0000_i1055" src="colorBar_arquivos/vermelho.png"> red (obtained on the extreme left in the bar),<br><br>
		- <img id="_x0000_i1054" src="colorBar_arquivos/vermelho2.png"> medium red (obtained in the central part of the bar) and<br><br>
		- <img id="_x0000_i1053" src="colorBar_arquivos/vermelho3.png"> dark red (obtained on the extreme right of the bar).
	</ul>
The bar needs at least two primary colors, that is, it is necessary to have at least one primary color on each extreme. The colors between the primary colors are the result of a mix between them. Other color grades can be obtained through operations that can be done in the bar with the mouse. These operations are used to:
	<ul>
		- insert colors,<br>
		- remove colors,<br>
		- substitute colors,<br>
		- change the distance between colors,<br>
		- change each color brightness and<br>
		- change simultaneously all the colors brightness.
	</ul>
With these operations it is possible to obtain different color grades.
<br><br>
All the operations are controlled by the mouse. Moving the mouse on the bar the cursor assumes different shapes or types:

	<br><br>
	Fig 2 –Possible cursor shapes according to the cursor position on the color bar.
</p>

<p>
	By moving the mouse on the bar, the shape of the cursor varies according to its position. The cursor shapes are the following:
	<ul>
	- <img id="_x0000_i1051" src="colorBar_arquivos/arrow.png"> &quot;arrow cursor&quot;, occurs when the mouse is where there is no primary color.<br><br>
	- <img id="_x0000_i1050" src="colorBar_arquivos/splith.png"> &quot;splitV cursor&quot; occurs when the mouse is on a primary color (except on the extremes of a bar).<br><br>
	- <img id="_x0000_i1049" src="colorBar_arquivos/splitv.png"> &quot;splitH cursor&quot; occurs when
the mouse is on a triangle in the color bar.
	</ul>
All operations are activated by the mouse and the cursor shape is related to the operation that follows (see <a href="#sumario">operations summary</a>). A double click activates the operation to insert or to remove a color. Drag a mouse on the bar to activate the operation to change the distance or the brightness of a color. Note that however less efficient, some operations
can also be made through the context menu.
<br><br>
Next, there is a detailed description of how to use the mouse to execute the operations on the color bar:

The insert of a new color is made by positioning the cursor on the desired place on the bar (Figure 3). The possible places to insert colors in the bar are identified by the shape of the cursor. When the cursor is of the shape &quot;ArrowCursor&quot; (the default shape), it indicates that it is possible to insert a new color at that place. A double click initiates the operation of color insert. The first step of this operation is to display a color select window, illustrated in Figure 4.

<p align="center">

	<br><br>
	Fig. 4 – Select color window.
</p>

A select color window is used to select a new color. Figure 5 shows a bar with a green color inserted. Note that the color insert occurs exactly on the place of the bar that was double clicked.
<p align="center">
<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1046" src="colorBar_arquivos/colorBar3.png">
<br><br>

</p>
The same operation can be activated by right clicking on the color bar and selecting 
  the option <em>Add Color</em> from the context menu. Shows the context menu. 
  <p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
Other colors can be added repeating the previous operation. Figure 7 shows the bar with the yellow color inserted between red and green colors.
<p align="center">

</p>

The distance between colors is modified by changing the primary color position on the bar. The new distance changes the number of colors between the primary colors. Figure 8 the yellow color being dragged (moved). Note that the mouse assumes the cursor shape of
the &quot;splitHCursor&quot; type when it is positioned on an area where there is a primary color. Note also that the primary colors are highlighted by the triangles right above the bar.

	<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1043" src="colorBar_arquivos/colorBar8.png">
	<br><br>
	Fig. 8 – Yellow color being shifted to the left.
</p>
Note: The colors on both ends cannot be moved. However, they can change position. For example, if the yellow color is moved to the left end, the yellow color will be the color on this end. Figure 9 shows a color bar where the yellow color was shifted to the left end, that is, the red color now is right next to the yellow color. This results in a bar where it is not possible to visualize the yellow color because the distance between the yellow and the red is too small. 
<p align="center">
	<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1042" src="colorBar_arquivos/colorBar9.png">
	<br><br>
	Fig. 9 – Bar displaying the yellow color being shifted all the way to the left.
</p>

With the yellow color placed on the left end, now it is possible to shift the red color. Figure 10 shows the red color being shifted on the bar. When the distance between the yellow and red colors is increased it is possible to see some graduation between them. 

<p align="center">

	<br><br>
	Fig. 10 – A color bar with the red color being shifted to the right.
</p>

Another possible operation through the bar is the replacement of one color by another. For this, the cursor assumes the &quot;splitVCursor&quot; mode. When the mouse is moved around one of the triangles right above the bar, the cursor assumes the &quot;splitVCursor&quot; mode. When in this mode, see Figure 11, a double click activates the interface of the color selection
(Figure 12) so the new color can replace the old one. Figure 13 shows a color bar after the replacement of the dark red color by the light blue color.

	<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1040" src="colorBar_arquivos/colorBar12.png">

	<br><br>

</p>

Another possible operation is the removal of a color. For this, place the mouse on one of the primary colors of the bar. The cursor will have the &quot;splitHCursor&quot; shape, see Figure 14. A double click removes the selected color. Figure 15 shows a color bar after removing the red color.

<p align="center">

	<br><br>

</p>

A bar also allows adjusting the color brightness. For this operation the cursor assumes the &quot;splitVCursor&quot; mode. The latter happens when the mouse is moved around one of the triangles above the color bar. Figure 16 shows the cursor in position to modify the brightness of the green color. This operation is started by moving the mouse up or down. Up increases and down
decreases brightness. Figure 17 shows the green color with reduced brightness.

	<br><br>

</p>

Another possible operation is to change the brightness of all colors simultaneously. In this operation the cursor assumes the
&quot;ArrowCursor&quot; mode. This is the default type of cursor and it is available in most parts of the color bar. Figure 18 illustrates the mouse in a position to start brightness change simultaneously. Next, drag the mouse up or down to start the operation. As soon as this happens, the cursor assumes the &quot;sizeVerCursor&quot; shape. This indicates that the brightness of all colors in the bar is changing according to the mouse movement. Figure 19 shows a bar during the operation of decreasing all the colors brightness.

OPERATIONS SUMMARY
<br><br>
Note that the operations depend on the cursor shape, and the cursor shape changes according to the place where they are on a color bar.
<br><br>
Depending on the cursor shape the following operations are activated by double clicking the mouse:
<ul>
	<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1031" src="colorBar_arquivos/arrow.png"> Add a new color to a bar.<br><br>
	<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1030" src="colorBar_arquivos/splith.png"> Remove one color from a bar.<br><br>
	<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1029" src="colorBar_arquivos/splitv.png"> Change one color in a bar.
</ul>
Depending on the cursor shape the following operations are activated by dragging the mouse:
<ul>
	<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1028" src="colorBar_arquivos/splith.png"> Move the color to the right or to the left.<br><br>
	<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1027" src="colorBar_arquivos/splitv.png"> Change selected color brightness. Up, it increases brightness and down, it decreases brightness.
	<br><br>
	<img border=0 id="_x0000_i1026" src="colorBar_arquivos/arrow.png"> When dragging the mouse the cursor shape changes to <img border=0 id="_x0000_i1025" src="colorBar_arquivos/sizever.png"> and it indicates that the brightness of all colors are changing.
