<hr>
<p align="justify">Address geocoding is the process that assigns the spatial location of a address. </p>
<p align="justify">It requires a detailed street network, where each street is divided in 
  segments and each segment has information about the initial and final street number of both sides 
  of the street. </p>
<p align="justify">The first step includes defining this layer and configuring it correctly to 
  indicate which fields contain useful information. Without this reference street data, address 
  geocoding can not be executed.  </p>
<p align="justify">The second step handles the table with addresses for geocoding, such as addresses 
  with cases of dengue fever. This table must be imported and indicated thatit will be used for 
  this purpose, that is, it is a "geocoding data" type. </p>
<p align="justify">In the sequence of geocoding wizard this table is configured by specifying  
  which of its fields contain relevant information. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, TerraView creates a new layer with a point with the geographic coordinates 
  calculated for each address. This layer attributes are filled with data from the imported geocoding 
  table. </p>
  
<p align="justify">  The geocoding wizard is available from <strong><b>File &gt; Address Geocoding</b></strong> option.
