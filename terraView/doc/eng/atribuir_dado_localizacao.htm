  <p>The operation of assigning data by location is executed between two selected 
    themes. It consists of adding a theme X attributes to a theme Y, based on 
    the spatial relationship between these two geographic objects. This operation 
    creates a new table of attributes consisting of the X attributes and it associates 
    X to the Y theme. There are two strategies for this operation: Distribute 
    and Collect. This operation takes into consideration two themes, theme X, 
    which provides the attributes and theme Y, which receives the attributes. 
  <p><strong>Distribute</strong> </p>
  <p>The distribution strategy consists of assigning attributes of each geographic 
    object of theme X to all objects of theme Y, which have a particular spatial 
    relationship. 
  <p><strong>Collect</strong></p>
  <p>Another very useful geographic operation comes from the need of generating 
    information from two distinct geographic objects. Imagine a situation in which 
    there is a map of Belo Horizonte divided into neighborhoods and overlaid upon 
    this map the point location of crimes committed in the year 2000. The desired 
    information is the number of crimes in each one of the neighborhoods, that 
    is, the count of how many point objects, which represent the crimes in 2000, 
    are inside each one of the polygons representing the neighborhoods.</p>
  <p>In this case, choose the <strong>Geographic</strong> Option <strong>&gt; 
    Assign Data by Location &gt; Collect</strong>. A window, like the one bellow, 
    will open up:</p>
  <p>1. Select a theme to assign data to.</p>
  <p>2. Select a theme to assign data from.</p>
  <p>3. Create and assign data to table.</p>
  <p>4. Choose the assign type, in this case, the number of crimes in 2000.</p>
  <p>5. Click <em>OK</em>.</p>

  <p align="justify"> In the Grid Area of the figure bellow, a new column was 
    generated from this procedure (crimes2000_object_) and it represents the count 
    of crimes in the year 2000 for each one of the neighborhoods in Belo Horizonte.</p>
