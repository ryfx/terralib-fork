       The Local Empirical Bayes estimator includes spatial effects, calculates the rate locally by 
       using only the geographic neighbors of the area where the rate is to be estimated, and converges 
       to a local mean. 
       Corrected rates are less unstable since their calculation considers not only area information, 
       but also neighborhood information. If a location has a sizable population, the rate will have 
       small variability and will be almost identical to the gross rate. 
       On the other hand, if a location has a small population, the gross rate estimation will have a 
       large variance and a small weight will be assigned to this unstable rate; therefore the bayes rate 
       will become closer to the value expected for a randomly selected area in the region.
      <br />
      It is also possible to adjust the rates based on the neighborhood information only.<br />
      <br />
      To estimate, use the <b>Analysis - Local Empirical Bayes</b> option. The Local Empirical Bayes 
      window will be displayed to define the input parameters:
<ol>
        <li>In <b>Theme</b> field, select UP theme.</li>
        <li>In <b>Population in Risk</b> field, select the table and the column with population data: 
          UP and POP_2000.</li>
        <li>In <b>Number of Cases</b> field, select the table and the column with data of numerator rate 
          (in this cas, homicides in 2000): hom_2000_Collect and Crimes2000.</li>
        <li>In <b>Multiplicative Rate Correction</b> field, select 1.</li>
        <li>Click on <b>OK</b> to create the new column, to be called LEBayes. If you wish, change 
          its name by typing in the <b>New Column Name</b> field.</li>
      </ol>

      In table UP, a new column will be presented: LEBayes, with the values of Local Bayes Rates for 
      each UP.</td>
