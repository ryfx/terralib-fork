<p align="justify"><strong>How to remap a layer from one projection to another?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">Each layer with objects with vector representation 
  is associated to a geographic projection,. which allows its objects to be located 
  geographically. When a theme linked to a layer is created in a view, it is possible that 
  this view has a geographic projection that is different from the layer projection.</p>
<p align="justify"> When a theme is drawn in the Draw Area, <em>TerraView</em> 
  recalculates the coordinates of the layer objects from the layer projection to the projection 
  of the theme view, if they are different. 
  This recalculation can be computationaly expensive when the layer/thems has 
  many objects and is frequently redrawn. In this case, it might be useful to 
  remap the layer to the same projection used for its visualization, and 
  recalculate object coordinates just once. </p>
<p align="justify"> The procedure to remap a layer P, with an associated theme 
  T, from aprojection to another consists in creating another layer with the destination 
  projection (in this case, equal to the view one), following these steps: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <ol>
    <li>Activate theme T popup menu and select <strong>Create Layer from Theme </strong> option. 
      An interface will be displayed to obtain information about the resulting Layer;</li>
    <li>In the left side box, <strong>Objects Selection</strong>, the usual option in this 
      case is <strong>Collection</strong> option, since all objects from theme T will be used 
      to create the new layer;</li>
    <li>In the right side box, <strong>New Layer</strong>, are the information about the 
      name of the layer to be created and its projection with their parameters. 
      The projection can be defined equal to the one of the view associated to the theme T, 
      which is usual in this case, or any other projection;</li>
  </ol>
  If the reason for remapping is the above one, do not forget to create a theme linked to 
  the new layer, in the same view used for visualization. </div>
