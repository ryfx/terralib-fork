In the moment, the only type of project avaible

and the terraOGC module:

/terralibw
/terraView
/terraViewPlugins
/terraViewPlugins/wmsclient
/extensions/terraOGC
/extensions/terraManager

In order to build, enter the directory
build/win32-msvc.net-2003, open the solution file
wmsclient.sln and build it. 

- Build on Linux:
Be sure to install the following libraries in your
Linux system (their devel package):
* xerces-c-2.7.0
